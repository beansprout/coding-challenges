/**
 * Given a single input string, write a function that produces all possible anagrams
 * of a string and outputs them as an array. At first, don't worry about
 * repeated strings.  What time complexity is your solution?
 *
 * Extra credit: Deduplicate your return array without using uniq().
 */

/**
  * example usage:
  * var anagrams = allAnagrams('abc');
  * console.log(anagrams); // [ 'abc', 'acb', 'bac', 'bca', 'cab', 'cba' ]

/* ideas: 
- split into letters
- each letter becomes a branch
- resultN (where n = incremental number to keep track of ansers)
- add a results array to push to
- add a current result (accumulator) to push characters of current result
